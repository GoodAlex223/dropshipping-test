// Kept as force-dynamic, NOT switched to `revalidate = 300` ISR. Verified
// against a real `npm run build`: the root layout (src/app/layout.tsx) declares
// its own `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because the app renders
// client-side auth context that doesn't survive static prerendering — that
// setting is inherited by every route and overrides any page-level revalidate,
// which is exactly what the build showed (`/` still listed as `ƒ (Dynamic)`
// with `revalidate = 300` set here). Confirmed the mechanism, not just the
// symptom: temporarily removing the root layout's force-dynamic and rebuilding
// made prerendering fail outright for "/" and 7 other routes with `TypeError:
// Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')` — i.e. this is a
// real, load-bearing, pre-existing constraint (not a Prisma/Neon adapter
// issue, which is what motivated this check), and changing it is a site-wide
// decision well outside a homepage-composition task.

// Two small, NON-async local helpers own this page's own two translated
// fragments (the benefits section's aria-label + items, the rail's
// title/viewAllLabel). Deliberately NOT inlined into the async HomePage
// function body below (TASK-039 G9): next-intl's `useTranslations` (the
// hook) is the only translation API proven to work for this component —
// `getTranslations` (the async-server-component API the repo's binding i18n
// convention would otherwise call for here) throws
// "`getTranslations` is not supported in Client Components" when the render
// tree is exercised directly by Vitest/RTL (`render(await HomePage())` in
// tests/unit/home-page.test.tsx), because Vitest resolves next-intl's
// package exports via the same condition real Client Components use — it has
// no concept of the React Server Components module graph Next's own bundler
// builds. `useTranslations` inside a plain (non-async) component sidesteps
// that entirely and is next-intl's documented, supported pattern for exactly
// this composition (translated leaf content inside an async Server
// Component's tree) — HomePage itself calls no next-intl API at all.
