## Adding Milestones

When creating new milestones:

1. **Define clearly** — What exactly constitutes completion?
2. **Set realistic date** — Account for dependencies and risks
3. **Identify dependencies** — What must happen first?
4. **Assess risks** — What could delay this?
5. **Assign owner** — Who is accountable?

---

## Milestone Review

### Review Questions

- Is the target date still realistic?
- Have dependencies been resolved?
- Are there new risks?
- Is scope still appropriate?
- Should this milestone be split?

### When to Adjust

Adjust milestones when:

- Scope significantly changed
- Critical dependency delayed
- Resources changed
- Priority shifted

Document all changes in the milestone entry.
