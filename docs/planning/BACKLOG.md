## Someday / Maybe

Ideas that might be valuable but aren't prioritized.

- [ ] Remove unused Prisma Account/Session tables if staying with JWT-only
- [ ] Add structured logging with error masking (replace console.error)
- [ ] Email templates for verification/reset flows
- [ ] User consent/privacy policy flow
- [ ] Audit logging for auth events
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to auth functions
- [ ] Extract password validation rules to shared schema

## Rejected Ideas

Ideas considered but decided against (with reasoning).

| Idea                             | Reason for Rejection                               | Date       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Database sessions instead of JWT | JWT is more scalable for serverless, simpler setup | 2026-01-13 |

## Promotion Criteria

Move items to [TODO.md](TODO.md) when:

- [ ] Aligns with current [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) phase
- [ ] Value clearly exceeds effort
- [ ] Dependencies are resolved
- [ ] Capacity exists to complete
- [ ] Stakeholder approval (if needed)

---

## Adding to Backlog

When adding new items:

1. Choose appropriate category
2. Provide brief description
3. Estimate Value and Effort (High/Med/Low)
4. Note the source (who suggested it)
5. Add date if relevant

_Promoted items go to [TODO.md](TODO.md)._
_Rejected items stay here with reasoning._
_See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for strategic direction._
