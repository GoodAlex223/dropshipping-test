    // Mobile Safari and Mobile Chrome. That alternating pattern rules out a
    // fixed CSS overlay/z-index bug (which would fail the same element every
    // time); it's the signature of a hydration-timing race instead. The CTA
    // links are static <a> tags already present in the SSR HTML — visible,
    // and passing Playwright's actionability checks, well before React has
    // hydrated and next/link's client-side router is ready. A click that
    // lands in that window can have its native navigation prevented without
    // the router completing the replacement navigation, silently dropping
    // it (no error is thrown — the click "succeeds", the URL just never
    // changes). Same class of bug as webkit-pre-hydration-e2e-testing (that
    // one was fill()-specific to WebKit; this one is click-based and not
    // engine-specific, since it reproduced on Chrome too).
    //
    // Fix: wait for a signal that's provably POST-hydration, not just
    // post-paint. CookieConsent (mounted globally) renders `null` until its
    // own `useEffect` fires — which cannot happen before hydration commits —
    // then shows this banner when consent is still "pending" (the default
    // for every fresh Playwright browser context). Waiting for it first,
    // before interacting with anything else on the page, is a reliable
    // "hydration has definitely happened" gate without touching product code.

    // states rather than assuming either: it waits briefly for the button
    // (covering the post-hydration reveal via useSyncExternalStore), and if
    // it never shows up, asserts the bar is genuinely absent and stops there.
    // If a real announcement is configured later, this same test starts
    // exercising the full dismiss-and-persist flow without needing an edit.
