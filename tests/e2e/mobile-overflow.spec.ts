 * The page must never scroll sideways on a phone.
 *
 * Found by the G20 visual gate: at 390px the homepage document measured 396px
 * wide. The cause was the footer's copyright-row nav — five Ukrainian link
 * labels in a `flex gap-6` with no wrap, 380px of content in 358px of
 * container — so it affected EVERY page that renders the footer, not one
 * layout.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices about where this lives:
 *
 * 1. **It sets its own viewport** rather than relying on a mobile project.
 *    CI runs `--project=chromium --project=webkit` only (see ci.yml), both
 *    desktop devices — a spec that depended on `Mobile Chrome`/`Mobile Safari`
 *    would pass locally and never run on the branch that matters.
 * 2. **It is an E2E test, not a unit test.** Nothing about this is visible to
 *    jsdom: it needs real layout, real fonts and a real viewport. A unit test
 *    asserting `flex-wrap` is in the className would only restate the fix.
